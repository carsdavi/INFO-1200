You said:
change for nfl team wins

ChatGPT said:
Got it! Let's adapt the GUI program to work with NFL team wins instead of just a generic number input.

‚úÖ Implemented Features (Same 5, just in a new context):
Input validated as a float number (e.g., handles "Ten" without crashing)

Display a value rounded to 3 decimal places

If-elif-else logic to interpret win totals

GUI with user input and button

Write result to .txt file

üìã Program Description:
The user enters the number of wins an NFL team has. The program:

Validates the input as a number.

Rounds it to 3 decimal places.

Displays whether it's a losing season (<9 wins), average season (exactly 9), or winning season (>9).

Saves the result to a file.

Shows results in a message box.
